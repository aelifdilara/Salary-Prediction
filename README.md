# Salary-Prediction

**Project Description**:
  The main purpose of the project is to make salary predictions by using descriptive
features in our dataset and different machine learning models and to make error rate
calculations and observe how accurate these predictions are. Data was collected from people
from different regions around the world in order to observe how values such as people's
education status and age caused changes in their salaries.

**Dataset Information**:
  This dataset consists of 6684 rows, 9 columns: Age, Gender, Education Level, Job
Title, Years of Experience, Salary, Country, Race and Senior. This dataset is compiled from
employment platforms and some surveys. It is useful to obtain information about labor
market trends in different professions. It is a dataset that can be used and analyzed to obtain
information about salaries and make informed decisions for business strategies. Salaries are
represented in US Dollars. For Senior, it is represented as 0 if the employee is in a senior
position, not 1.   
For Education Level   
0 : High School   
1: Bachelor Degree  
2: Master Degree  
3 : Phd  
It is represented as.   
  
This project contains the steps of Data Exploaration, Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection (used both Boruta and Correlation Matrix), Visualization and Total of 6 different Models which are:
  
*Single Linear Regression*  
*Multi-Linear Regression*  
*Decision Tree*  
*Random Forest*  
*Gradient Boosting*  
*Neural Network*
